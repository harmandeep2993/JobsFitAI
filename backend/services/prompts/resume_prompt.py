    2. Resume may be in any language - return ALL values in English.
    3. skills: scan EVERY section (experience bullets, projects, summary, certifications, publications) - every technology, tool, methodology, and soft skill mentioned anywhere goes in skills[]. Use canonical lowercase names: expand abbreviations (k8s -> kubernetes, js -> javascript, ml -> machine learning, nlp -> natural language processing, gcp -> google cloud, postgres -> postgresql) but keep standard acronyms (aws, sql, etl, sap). No duplicate spellings.
    4. experience_entries: ALL roles count - jobs, internships, working student, freelance, research positions, teaching, volunteer work.
    5. Dates: normalize to MM/YYYY (or YYYY when no month is shown); ongoing roles get end_date "present". Never invent dates. Always set duration_years and meta.total_experience_years to 0 - they are computed after extraction.
    6. Academic profiles: research positions belong in experience_entries, papers in publications[], thesis title in education.
